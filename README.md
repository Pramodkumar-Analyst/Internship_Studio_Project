# Internship_Studio_Project
The aim of this project is to use Python, SQL, and Excel to analyze sales  data and generate meaningful reports for a retail chain.</br>
</br>
Methodology:- ✔ Data Acquisition and Preparation: ➡ Data Sourcing: Obtained sales data in CSV format from Kaggle and established a secure local storage path.</br> 
➡ Database Design and Implementation: Constructed a SQL database schema tailored to the dataset, creating necessary tables using SQL DDL commands to efficiently store and manage data.</br> 
➡ Data Cleaning and Validation: Employed SQL queries and Python (Pandas) to meticulously identify and rectify data inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers, ensuring data integrity.</br>
➡ Data Enrichment: Generated calculated fields (e.g., total sales, month/year) using SQL and Python to expand dataset utility for in-depth analysis.</br>

✔ Exploratory and Advanced Analysis:</br> 
➡ Descriptive Analysis: Utilized SQL and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover initial data patterns, trends, and relationships through summary statistics and visualizations.</br> 
➡ In-depth Analysis: Conducted sophisticated analyses such as time series forecasting, cohort analysis, and customer segmentation using Python's advanced libraries to derive actionable insights.</br>

✔ Reporting and Visualization:</br> 
➡ Report Generation: Produced comprehensive tabular reports (sales by product, store, time period) using SQL and Python, and formatted them in Excel for clarity and professionalism.</br> 
➡ Data Visualization: Created compelling visual representations (charts, graphs) using Python's visualization libraries to effectively communicate complex findings.</br> 
➡ Dashboard Development: Integrated tabular and visual reports into an interactive Excel dashboard to provide a holistic view of sales performance and facilitate data-driven decision-making.</br>
